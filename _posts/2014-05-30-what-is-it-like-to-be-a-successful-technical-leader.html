<p>Being a successful technical leader is not limited to your technical ability. Your success exceeds your knowledge to your leadership skills.</p>
<p>Now, that you have a team to manage, work with and defend on, you need to be aware of the techniques that will soften everybody's life, and of course make your career a successful one. This is something that's harder than you might think as a start. There is a lot to learn and several skills to master.</p>
<p>I have gathered a collection of resources for you to read. I highly recommend that you read them and apply them occasionally. Best if luck!</p>
