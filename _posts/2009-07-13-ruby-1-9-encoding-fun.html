<p>Ruby 1.9 has a great support for encoding, <a href="http://blog.nuclearsquid.com/writings/ruby-1-9-encodings">this</a> post covers that for a big deal, however with this support out of the box, things like <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2007/10/fun_with_unicode_1.html">this</a> becomes easier, just note the source code is not limited to few types of encoding just like Ruby 1.8.</p>
{% highlight ruby  %}
# coding: UTF-8

π = Math::PI

def √(x) 
  Math.sqrt(x)
end

def ∑(r)
  r.inject{|sum,val| sum + (block_given? ? yield(val) : val)}
end 

def ∏(r)
  r.inject(1){|mul,val| mul * (block_given? ? yield(val) : val)}
end 

def ¬(x)
  !x
end  

p π #=> 3.14159265358979

p √(9) #=> 3.0

range = 1..6 

p ∑(range)  #=> 21

p ∑(range){|x| x**2}  #=> 91

p ∏(range)  #=> 720

p ∏(range){|x| x**2}  #=> 518400

p ¬(5>0) #=> false

<p><strong>Please note that previous example could work also with Ruby 1.8 using the flag<code> -Ku</code>, I just wanted to explain the idea of using different types of encoding in Ruby 1.9.</strong></p>
<p>So all you need to do is to set whatever encoding you want for your source code at the very beginning of the file:</p>
{% highlight ruby  %}
# coding: UTF-8
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Many other things can be done, just give yourself a moment and think what you can do!</p>
