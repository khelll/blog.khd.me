<p>According to wikipedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">Metaprogramming</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>is the writing of computer programs that write or manipulate other programs (or themselves) as their data, or that do part of the work at runtime that would otherwise be done at compile time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, nice to hear cause Ruby is a lang that supports Metaprogramming effectively, and might be the best in that field. If you want to explore more on that topic, and how ruby can help you, then check this list of posts i wrote recently, i hope you will enjoy them:</p>
