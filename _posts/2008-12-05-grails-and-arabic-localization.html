<p>A little problem that i faced with grails , was setting the locale dynamically, i followed this <a href="http://www.grassr.com/wordpress/?p=12">nice article</a> , and here is how i could manage it :</p>
<ol>
<li>I made a new file called messages_ar.properties that contains the arabic localization under the i18n folder.</li>
<li>I made a simple beforeinterceptor:
{% highlight groovy  %}def beforeInterceptor = {
        def key = "org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet.LOCALE_RESOLVER"
        def localeResolver = request.getAttribute(key)
        localeResolver.setLocale(request, response, new Locale("ar","JO"))
    }{% endhighlight %}
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course you can use <a href="http://grails.org/Filters">grails/Filters</a> to save yourself repeating the same code in every controller.</p>
<p>However what i want to mention is the locale object, which in case of Arabic localization, was seeking  the country argument ( "JO" in our case) :</p>
{% highlight groovy  %}
new Locale("ar","JO")
{% endhighlight %}
<p>While for other localizations like German one it doesn't seek this second argument, so this snippet of code will work for them :)</p>
{% highlight groovy  %}
new Locale("de")
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Also you can change this country argument value to match this rule :</p>
<blockquote><p>
The country argument is a valid ISO Country Code. These codes are the upper-case, two-letter codes as defined by ISO-3166. You can find a full list of these codes at a number of sites, such as:<br />

<p>I hope that was helpful :) , enjoy!</p>
